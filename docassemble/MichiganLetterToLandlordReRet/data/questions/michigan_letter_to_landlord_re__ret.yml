  DIY tool for writing a Letter to Landlord (Security Deposit)
subquestion: |
  This interview will help you write a Do-It-Yourself Letter to Landlord (Security Deposit).
  
  Use this tool if you have **not** gotten your **security deposit** from your previous landlord and it’s been more than **30 days** since you moved out of your old home.
  
  This tool assumes you gave your previous landlord your **forwarding address** within **four days** of moving out of the home.
  
  If you did **not** give your landlord your forwarding address within four days, the timelines in this letter do not apply and you should not use this tool. If that is the case, click [here](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/self-help-tools/housing/security-deposit-help-tenants) to return to the Michigan Legal Help web site to learn more.
  
  Otherwise, please click the 'Next' button below.
