question: |
  DIY tool for writing a Letter to Landlord (Security Deposit)
subquestion: |
  This interview will help you write a Do-It-Yourself Letter to Landlord (Security Deposit).
  
  Use this tool if you have not gotten your security deposit from your previous landlord and itâ€™s been more than 30 days since you moved out of the home.
  
  This tool assumes you gave your previous landlord your forwarding address within four days of moving out of the home.
  
  If you did not give your landlord your forwarding address within four days, the timelines in this letter do not apply and you should not use this tool. If that is the case, please click the "Exit" button below to return to the Michigan Legal Help web site to learn more.
  
  Otherwise, please click the Continue button below.
  
  Most people take about 15-20 minutes to finish this interview.
